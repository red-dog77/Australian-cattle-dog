          The Australian Cattle dog or (Heeler) as they are more commonly
          referred to are working dog breed to prodominently herd cattle.
          Because of their tough and stubbon personalitys they are considered to
          be one of the best breeds for this kind of challenging work.
          <br />
          Heelers have the ability to move very fast and bite the heels of the
          cattle in order to get stubbon cattle to move when the dog wants them
          to move and more importantly where they want them to move. The natural
          ability of the heeler to herd livestock and anticipate the movement of
          livestock makes them a farmers best asset when moving large herds of
          cattle, they can think for themself with only very basic directions
          about what is needed from their master.
          <br />
          Heelers typicaly come in two types either Red Heeler or Blue Heeler,
          although they are essentially the same dog with only different
          colorings the do have quiet different attitudes.

          What is Lorem Ipsum? Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing
          and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard
          dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley
          of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived
          not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic
          typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in
          the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum
          passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like
          Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
